summary: "Clean, modern geometric designs inspired by Bauhaus and minimalist art movements"

This collection features simple geometric patterns that demonstrate the beauty found in basic shapes and mathematical precision. Each design explores the interplay between form, color, and composition using only fundamental geometric elements.

These patterns echo the principles of Bauhaus design and minimalist art movements, where simplicity and clarity create visual harmony through careful arrangement of circles, squares, triangles, and lines.
