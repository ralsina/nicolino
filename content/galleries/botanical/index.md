This collection features botanical illustrations inspired by the groundbreaking work of **Nehemiah Grew (1641-1712)**, an English plant anatomist who published "Anatomy of Plants" in 1680. Grew was among the first scientists to use microscopes to study plant structure, revealing the intricate vascular networks and reproductive organs that had never been documented before.

These illustrations echo Grew's meticulous approach to botanical science, combining artistic beauty with scientific accuracy. His work laid the foundation for modern plant anatomy and represented a crucial leap forward in understanding plant biology during the Scientific Revolution.
