Nicolino 0.5.0 is here! This release brings several major new features and improvements.

## What's New

### Code Listings Feature
The biggest addition in this release is the **code listings feature**, inspired by Nikola. You can now place source code files in content/listings/ and Nicolino will automatically generate syntax-highlighted HTML pages with line numbers.

Features include:
- Syntax highlighting for 40+ programming languages using tartrazine
- Automatic language detection from file extensions
- Line numbers for easy reference
- Collapsible raw source view
- Beautiful dark theme support
- Files output to output/listings/ for clean URLs

### Archive Page
New archive page organizes all your posts by year and month with collapsible sections.

### Improved Metadata Handling
- Mandatory YAML metadata with --- delimiters
- Strict date parsing as hard errors
- Updated timestamp only shows when different
- External link display support

### Pandoc Conversion Script
Convert Pandoc posts to Markdown for faster builds.

### Auto-Installing Templates and Assets
Missing templates and assets are automatically restored from baked filesystem.
