# WARNING

This is a toy. Do not use this for anything important.

# What is it tho?

It's a SSG, a Static Site Generator. You know, those things where
you write some markdown and end up with a website.

# Why?

Because I am learning [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) and I know
a lot about SSGs, so it's a nice project.

# Will it be any good?

Probably not? I am an old guy and my energy is limited and I don't 
**need** this, so I will just keep adding stuff while it's fun.

# What's in it?

Not much:

* Markdown with normal YAML metadata
* Pages and Posts (which have dates)
* RSS feed generation
* Generates HTML

It's pretty fast?

# What's planned?

Nothing is planned, this is strictly a make it up as you go operation.
BUT:

* Tags
* Output conflicts
* Incremental builds
* Image galleries
* Nice things

# What's NOT planned?

It will not be massively flexible. For that you may want to look at [Nikola](https://getnikola.com) which can do pretty much anything because it had to be able to generate exactly my site which has 20 years of weird stuff in it.

This will be a more "convention over configuration" affair. Posts go in `posts/`, pages in `pages/`, that sort of thing.
